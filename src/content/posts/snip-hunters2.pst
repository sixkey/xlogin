In this snippet, I am evolving simple agents for object finding. 
# Description
The second version of @@snip-hunters@@. The learning model is more supervised via curated natural selection. Each time hunter eats food, his fitness goes up. The evolution system grabs all hunters after a set period, picks the ones with the highest fitness (i.e. the highest number of eaten food), and populates a new generation by copying and mutating their genes.
Hunters 2 also runs on a new ECS system added in spool2.
